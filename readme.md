# FASTINFO

![DASHBOARD LOGO](dashboard.png)

Sometimes you may have a business or organisation , but people that need your services don’t know that your business or organisation exists, and people might need to work in or for your business but they don’t know if it is possible at the moment.

FastInfo is a website project that offers information about various organisations, including schools, markets, private hospitals,small business, companies , shops, and more. Organisations register themselves and post essential information for individuals considering working with them for the first time. The issue is that people may not be aware of whether a particular service they need exists or not. Organisations always need to communicate to the world that they are capable of satisfying people's needs. This is good because it  make advertisement easily

People spend a lot of time   searching for specific services because they don’t know where the services are still available.

We also help small businesses and entrepreneurs to get known easily without the need for advertisement which is expensive.
